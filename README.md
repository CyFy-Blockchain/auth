## ðŸ“˜ DB Design

This project uses TypeORM to manage associations between entities in a relational database. Below is an overview of the entities and their relationships, with TypeScript code examples for each.

### ðŸ—‚ Entity Relationships:

1. Organisation has a one-to-many relationship with Departments.
2. Organisation has a one-to-one relationship with Admins.
3. Departments have a one-to-many self-referencing relationship with other Departments (a parent department can have multiple child departments).
4. Departments have a one-to-many relationship with Users.
5. Users have a one-to-one relationship with Students.
6. Users have a one-to-one relationship with Admins.

### In summary:

Each Organisation can have multiple Departments and a single Admin.
Each Department can have multiple child departments, multiple students, and multiple admins.
Users serves as a polymorphic association for both Students and Admins.
